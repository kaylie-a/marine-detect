The dataset includes 758 images.
Blue-ringed-octopus are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -5 and +5 degrees
